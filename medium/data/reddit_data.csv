Shirer",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14a6afh/,3.0,1.0, I must admit this book was no light read  It is a hefty volume  and at times  the sheer magnitude of the events covered where overwhelming  However  Shirer s engaging narrative style kept me hooked till the end  Shirer s storytelling skills are remarkable  transforming the complexities of this dark period into a captivating narrative that reads like a movie screenplay   I m curious to hear if any of you have read this book and what your thoughts are  Did you find it as enthralling as I did  Do you have other recommendations for similarly gripping historical reads ,251.0,

Why?,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14ahh8r/,0.0,0.0,I ve found a variety of nonfiction  self help  memoirs  biographies  and fictional books motivating or inspiring  They are helpful for different things and at different times   The book that I ve found most motivating these days is an old self help book by Eckhart Tolle s  called The Power of Now  Like many self help books  it is far from perfect  For example  it can get repetitive  And it oversimplifies certain things  But all in all  I feel my time has not been wasted reading it   Here are three quotes from the book  just to give you an idea of what it s like   1  When you act out of present moment awareness  whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality  care  and love   even the most simple action  2  Past and future obviously have no reality of their own  Just as the moon has no light of its own  but can only reflect the light of the sun  so are past and future only pale reflections of the light  power  and reality of the eternal present  Their reality is  borrowed  from the Now  3  Any lesson from the past becomes relevant and is applied now  Any planning as well as working toward achieving a particular goal is done now   The reason I find this book motivating is that it helps ground me in the present  where my true power lies  A lot of my time is wasted worrying about future or regretting past actions  to the point that sometimes I don t feel fully present or aware of what is going on around me or where I am  So  I feel a lack of motivation only because I m reacting to things that happened  before  or  could  happen in the future   Therefore  the book s message  though deceptively simple  is a useful reminder for me to stop and come back to the here and now  where I  can  make a difference   What have you found helpful when you feel depressed or lack motivation  and why ,145.0,

Heinlein's ""Stranger in a Strange Land"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13y2muq/,47.0,49.0,Finished tonight a book that has certainly been intriguing as it was entertaining  And that book was the best selling science fiction novel  Stranger in a Strange Land  by Robert A  Heinlein   In this novel we are introduced to Valentine Michael Smith  a human who for most of life had been raised by the inhabitants of Mars  And never once did he meet another member of his own kind   That is until he was sent Earth  where he is an absolute stranger there  and must learn what it means to be a man   But the the beliefs and powers that he has exceeds the limits of humanity  As he teaches grokking and grokking to the human race he is also inspiring a major transformation forever changing the inhabitants of Earth   Robert A  Heinlein was the first author to bring science fiction into the mainstream audience but it should also be brought to mind that he was also a controversial figure with a very complicated viewpoint or viewpoints  It s strange to see a man that is both a libertarian and an ultra conservative at the same time   When he wrote  Stranger in a Strange Land  he wrote with the idea of free love  but what that meant to him  well  is quite different from what would come later  But his ideas aside  when it came out in 1961 in an edited form  it was a bit longer initially and the version I read was the original uncut one from Ace  it was a hit  It didn t matter which side of the political spectrum you re on  everyone loved it and the book became a best seller  And further more it was a really big hit with the love generation and the counterculture hippie movement just ate it up   The story is pretty good and even funny  while I might not  grok the fullness of it  entirely  it is very enjoyable science fiction ,1408.0,

stars    American Loyalist Troops 1775 84 is a long  boring and dry compilation of every known unit of Loyalist troops in the war and whether they used red  green or blue coats  The Osprey veteran Ren  Chartrand packs as much information as he could find to fill this 48 pages Man at Arms book  The resut is an endless list of unit names with a stub of one or two short paragraphs detailing basic pieces of uniform like buttons  coat facings and other memorabilia of interest only for modellers and reenactors   It doesn t read as the usual Ren  Chartrand book  and is clearly below his high standards  The list of units is too long and most of the information is too vague for the narrative to flow normally  The plates are okay  but nothing outstanding  In one of the good plates  E3  a ranger from Jessup s Loyal Rangers stands above a bluecoat he killed in the bush  Plate A2 has a black ex slave of the Ethiopian Regiment with  Liberty to Slaves  written on his shirt  The rest is very repetitive and bland   The photographs of pieces of cloth  flags and portraits are too dark and blackened to be useful  One portrait of LtCol Banastre Tarleton is well represented  which is nice  The portrait of Thayeadanegea  Joseph Brant   the Mohawk Chief  is too dark to be useful   The loyalists are described as being a no insignificant 20  of the population in the original 13 Colonies and coming from recent migrants from Britain  public servants  landowners and businessmen with strong ties with the metropole  freed black slaves and ordinary citizens that felt the Crown would protect their rights better than  the rampaging advocates of  Liberty   who in practice often turned violently upon anyone who disagreed with their arguments   Since the revolutionaries were quick to seize property of those who opposed the independence  and massacred loyalist troops and hanged loyalist officers  that s not far fetched   The main contributions of the loyalist  Tories  was to provided highly accurate intelligence  light infantry and cavalry units that placed the revolutionaries in a plain field for a larger  more powerful regular British army to maneuver and fight in the bigger battles  with many ranger and loyal regiments and legions  Without the French and the Spanish there is no way the 13 colonies would have won  The most effective loyalist units were the Butler s Rangers  the British Legion  the Loyal American Legion and the Queen s Rangers  Other units have pompous names like  Royal Fencible Americans  and  Emmerich s Chasseurs   Some units were big enough to fight in pitched battles while many others were too small to anything but understrength garrison duty  The main commands were New York  Canada and the Caribbean  all three conducting their operations independently   This book s subject is too vast and should have been done in three volumes so each region could be explored properly  from the Canadian wilderness to the more adventuresque Caribbean fighting against the Spanish  The odyssey of United Corps of Pennsylvania   Maryland Loyalists is quite interesting  being sent to Pensacola via Jamaica  they were captured by the Spanish in Pensacola and sent as prisoners to Havana  in Cuba  Being exchanged they were sent back to New York until resettled in New Br nswick after the war   Oddballs were French Canadian settlers who were forced into service  including with threats from conscripting two married men to each deserter  and Indians serving with the British  given that expansion into Indian lands was a major factor in the deflagration of the war it is easy to see why   The book ends with the loyalists being ressettled as units  accompanied with their families  into British Canada  The British governament cared for them until their communities became self sustained  Many had been persecuted and had their property seized  some were murdered  Five great fleets resettled over 35 000 loyalists and their families in Canada  A woman is mentioned as not having shed a tear during the war but being overcome by grief as  while holding her baby  she watched the ships that resettled them sail away  but doesn t really quote what she said  Page 40 depicts a draft of loyalists drawing lots for their land alongside their wives  After all lots were set  the units were disbanded  Chartrand then presents a vast bibliography and the plate details   The mindset of those men and women really warrant further study  such as a Warrior title  Recently Osprey announced a Combat title and that s a good thing  Ren  Chartrand ends his narrative with the words  Indeed  although the fact is largely unappreciated in present day Canada  it was the Loyalists who brought north many of the basic political and cultural institutions that now largely define the modern nation  Like the French Canadians they joined in their new country  the Loyalists surmounted the consequences of a lost war  and built a new and forward looking society that preserved their ideals  ,5005.0,
